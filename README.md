## Hi there,

This is kaalam, the authors of the Jazz platform.

  * Our Twitter account is [@kaalam_ai](https://twitter.com/kaalam_ai)

  * Our website is [kaalam.ai](http://kaalam.ai/)



## What is jazz

  * The main project is [Jazz](https://github.com/kaalam/Jazz), to build lifelong learning systems in C++.

  * Jazz is a [lightweight AI platform](https://kaalam.github.io/jazz_reference/vision_intro_page.html).

  * The final goal is generating code automatically leveraging on human-written code. We have a proof of concept.

  * The science making this possible is [Formal Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14075).

  * An easier introduction can be found in [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/SantiagoBasalda/jazz-open-expo-europe-june-2020).

  * The whole PoC implementation in Python applied to the ARC challenge can be found in [JazzARC](https://github.com/kaalam/JazzARC)


## The Tangle: A Connected Dataset of English Grammar and Curated Text

  * The presentation [poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaalam/kaalam/master/the_tangle.pdf)
  * Docker and Python packages [instructions](https://kaalam.github.io/jazz_reference/reference_docker_tangle_server.html)


## Our recent deliveries are

  * Jazz 0.5.1 - The first complete Jazz platform with every Block type, Container, communication channel and server 100% complete.

  * Jazz 0.5.2 - Some API enhancements to simplify usage.

  * The Tangle 0.5.2 The first version of "The Tangle: A Connected Dataset of English Grammar and Curated Text" on Jazz 0.5.2


## Our current challenges are

  * Building a community! We need help.

  * Releasing [Jazz](https://github.com/kaalam/Jazz) 0.6.1. The first C++ implementation of Formal Fields

  * Combining multiple Formal Fields in a lifelong learning system. (PoC and paper in preparation)
